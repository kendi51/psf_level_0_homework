"""
There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

Example
a = [2,6]
b = [24,36]

There are two numbers between the arrays: 6 and 12.
6 % 2 = 0, 6 % 6 = 0, 24%6 = 0 and 36 % 6 = 0 for the first value.
12 % 2 = 0, 12 % 6 = 0 and 24 % 12 = 0, 36 % 12 = 0  for the second value. Return 2.
